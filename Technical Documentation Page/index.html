                <p>
                    We are gamers who love playing RPG games and fantasy. We started on console games 
                    and a little PC gaming but never had the chance to get into the larger TTRPG style games. 
                    Every time we looked around for a local store to go and get new games or accessories, we 
                    could never find one that catered more towards table-top games. So we decided to change 
                    that and open one ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we wanted to create a space where people could not only come get table-top games, but also 
                    the fantasy card games, as well as accessories and collectables. Secondly, we wanted a place where
                    gamers could meet up and have a space to play those games as well as meet like minded people who 
                    are into the same kind of gaming.
